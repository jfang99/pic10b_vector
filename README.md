This is the implementation of my own class "vector" under the namespace "pic10b".
The class "vector" is templated in order to be suited for three types of variable types - int, double, and string.

Just like std::vector, my own class pic10b::vector can handle different types of operations, such as "*", "+", "+=", "<", etc.
It is also implemented with the big 4 - default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor.
Basic functions are also handled by my pic10b::vector, such as push_back(), pop_back().

Overall, my pic10b::vector doesn't have many helpful functions as std::vector does, but the implementation of my pic10b vector may give the reader some idea how inner structure of the container "vector".
